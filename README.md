•	Reinforcement is a form of conservation translocation used to stabilise or enhance populations
•	Typically considered in the context of extant populations i.e. reinforcement as a category of conservation translocation– but reinforcement is also a phase within reintroduction
•	Benefits of reinforcing release assumed but rarely empirically tested – and if they are its usually from perspective of reinforcing individuals, not the population as a whole
•	Outcomes of reinforcement are mediated by social interactions, which are also assumed but not often empirically tested
•	Here we test the outcomes of reinforcement for a population of bush stone-curlew where all individuals in the population (previously released and reinforcing) are accounted for and tracked with GPS
•	We ask: do the cohorts integrate? And do social interactions benefit the reinforcing cohort?
